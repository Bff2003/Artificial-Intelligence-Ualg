            The ac3 function should, using the AC3 algorithm, enforce arc consistency on the problem. Recall that arc consistency is achieved when all the values in each variable's domain satisfy that variable's binary constraints.
                Recall that the AC3 algorithm maintains a queue of arcs to process. This function takes an optional argument called arcs, representing an initial list of arcs to process. If arcs is None, your function should start with an initial queue of all of the arcs in the problem. Otherwise, your algorithm should begin with an initial queue of only the arcs that are in the list arcs (where each arc is a tuple (x, y) of a variable x and a different variable y).
                Recall that to implement AC3, you'll revise each arc in the queue one at a time. Any time you make a change to a domain, though, you may need to add additional arcs to your queue to ensure that other arcs stay consistent.
                You may find it helpful to call on the revise function in your implementation of ac3.
